\section*{Mission}

We are looking for a programmer to join our research group, Parietal
team, at INRIA, to work on \href{http://nilearn.github.io}{Nilearn}, a
library applying advanced machine learning and signal processing to
functional brain imaging.

As a programmer, you will be developing tools for the analysis of
cognitive neuroscience and "functional connectivity" --brain
connectivity inferred using functional MRI. Large databases have been
made available with these types of data and require powerful data
analysis software.

The project unites neuroscientists, data-miners, statisticians and
clinical researchers to transfer recent advances in basic neuroscience
to clinical diagnostic tools.
%
Your duties will be to work hand in hand
with the computer science and statistics researchers to turn the
research code into a solid and well documented Python library usable
by clinical researchers.
%
In particular, to make the core data-processing routines more usable,
the project will develop specific data visualization. The technologies
used rely on the scientific Python stack and scikit-learn machine
learning library.

\section*{Job Offer description}
\begin{itemize}
%  \item Integration of the Nistats library into Nilearn, in order to
%    simplify the long term maintenance of thee libraries and have a
%    more consistent framework for users.
%  \item Improve Nilearn API with the introduction of more high-level
%    objects for the sake of supervised analysis (decoder object) and
  %    the estimation of patterns from the data (clustering object)
\item Improvement and homogenization of the library API, generation
  of automated reports for group analyses, facilitation of statistical
  analyses (contrast specification).
\item Integration within the \href{https://ebrains.eu}{EBRAINS} (Human
  Brain Project) platform users to run connectivity analyses
  (estimation, visualization, population modeling) there. This
  involves the following steps: 1) Integrate of Nilearn into EBRAINS,
  2) development of new functionalities for manipulation of brain
  regions, integrated in the EBRAINS atlas viewer.
  \item Integration of the NIDS and NIDM standards into Nilearn: these
    will make data analysis easier by automatically obtaining
    information on the data organization on the file system (BIDS) and
    outputting artifacts compatible with other tools (NIDM).
   \item Introduction of advanced tools developed by
     Parietal, e.g. efficient multivariate estimators, for which we
     already have academic results and code, but the integration
     (uniform API, cleaning and documentation) still has to be done.
   \item Animation of the developers community, organization of \href{https://nilearn.github.io/dev-days-2020/}{events}
     (brainhack, coding sprints, training on software development).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Skills and profile}

\begin{itemize}
\item love high-quality code and open source
\item worry about users and like to communicate
\item be curious about data (ie like looking at data and understanding it)
\item have an affinity for problem-solving tradeoffs
\item good scientific Python coders
\item enjoy interacting with a community of developers
\item interest in brain imaging and its applications.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Working at Inria}
Established in 1967, Inria is the only public research body fully
dedicated to computational sciences.

Combining computer sciences with mathematics, Inriaâ€™s 3,500
researchers strive to invent the digital technologies of the
future. Educated at leading international universities, they
creatively integrate basic research with applied research and dedicate
themselves to solving real problems, collaborating with the main
players in public and private research in France and abroad and
transferring the fruits of their work to innovative companies.

The researchers at Inria published over 4,500 articles in 2019. They
are behind over 300 active patents and 120 start-ups. The 172 project
teams are distributed in eight research centers located throughout
France.

\subsection*{Working with Parietal team}
Besides permanent researchers, the developer will be in contact with
PhD students that do software development as part of their PhD
contract, and with the developer team that contributes to scikit-learn
and Joblib, supported by the scikit-learn consortium.
%
He or she will also be in contact with cognitive and clinical
neuroscientists at NeuroSpin.

Parietal researchers use English as a common language for their
activities (daily interactions, weekly meetings, yearly retreats).


\subsection*{Benefits}

\begin{itemize}
\item Canteen and cafeteria;
\item Sports equipment;
\item Transport reimbursement
